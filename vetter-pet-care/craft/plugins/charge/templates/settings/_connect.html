            <h3>FieldType Setup</h3>
            <p>Charge uses a fieldtype - <strong>Charge_ConnectFieldType</strong> to associate elements to Stripe Connect sub accounts.</p>
            <p>The most common setup is to attach the <strong>Charge_ConnectFieldType</strong> to the <em>User</em> element type, but you can attach it to <em>any valid element type</em> as best makes sense for your implementation requirments.</p>
            <p>Once attached to an element you can use the built in Craft permissions to control who has control over the connected account for specific elements.</p>
            <p><em>Set the fieldtype up from the Craft > Settings > Fields area as for any other Craft field.</em></p>

            <p>As part of the Connect flow you must define the redirect url for the application on the Stripe dashboard
                settings.</p>

            <p><em>You can specify multiple redirect urls in the Stripe settings by separating multiple urls with a
                    comma (,). <br/>Be sure to include all the urls for the various environment domains this will be
                    running on.</em></p>

            <h3>Connect Behaviour</h3>

            <p>Stripe Connect has two options for charging the accounts. <strong>Destination</strong> and <strong>Direct</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Destination</strong> means all charges are routed through your main account first, before being passed down to the connected accounts. This makes overall bookkeeping and refunds simpler. The platform account pays any Stripe fees (but these can be absorbed into any percentage fee you might apply to payments).</p>
            <p><strong>Direct</strong> charges the connected account directly, and only the fee collected is sent to your account. The connected account pays any Stripe fees.</p>


            {{ forms.selectField({
                name: 'connect[behaviour]',
                value: (connect.behaviour is defined ? connect.behaviour : 'destination' ),
                options: [
                    {
